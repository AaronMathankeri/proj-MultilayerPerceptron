One brief sentence on what you did at a high level. 15 words max.
"Created scaling function for temp readings"

A mini-paragraph explaining in detail what you did. For example,

a function named 'scaleFeatures'. I used the library function from
dplyr to achieve this. Scaling is now done before analysis."
