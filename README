 INTRODUCTION
The multilayer perceptron(mlp), or feed forward neural network,
is a parametric pattern recognition model. It has acheived
much popularity in recent years due to the advances of many technologies
exploiting many core architectures.

Here, I implement a simple MLP using hyper efficient computational
subroutines to quickly train the network.

The MLP is fit to data sampled from U(-1,1) and evaluated for f(x) = x^2.
The goal of the MLP is to learn the x^2 given the dataset.
This framework is easily extended to different regression problems, and the
extension to classification requires the output be transformed using a
logistic sigmoid function.
